# LightsOut

Welcome!
This repository contains the contents of the LightsOut project written by Daniel Akbarzadeh. It was created in response to an assignment for CS246 at the University of Waterloo; however, all code contained within is written by me and me only.

This project was written in ___C++___ using the ___Observer design pattern___.

More information on its member folders follow.

### Project Files
This folder contains the implementations and interface files of all the classes that make up the final executable, as well as client that handles inputs (game commands). A Makefile is also included to allow easy compilation of the project.

### Test Files
This folder contains the test suite for this project, contained within the suite*.txt file. They consist of black-box, functional tests which are also used as regression tests. They were also supplemented with more information once white-box-level knowledge of the program was available after its implementation, as I was actively looking for ways to break my own code. The files ending in .in and .out for each test case will likely be of most interest to you.
